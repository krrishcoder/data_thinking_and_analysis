## 1. Why is expense trend analysis important in accounting software?

Expense trend analysis helps accounting teams:

* Track how costs evolve over time
* Identify overspending early
* Plan budgets more accurately
* Detect unusual or fraudulent transactions
* Support GST audits and compliance

Without trend analysis, businesses often react **after** financial issues occur rather than preventing them.

## 2. What could be misleading if data quality is poor?

Poor data quality can lead to:

* Incorrect trend interpretation due to missing invoices
* Inflated or deflated expenses from duplicate records
* Wrong category-level insights if expenses are misclassified
* Incorrect GST reporting due to wrong tax rates

In accounting systems, **small data errors can cause large financial and compliance risks**, which is why data validation is critical.

**Overall Thought:**

Simple, clean data analysis—when done correctly—often provides more business value than complex models built on unreliable data.
